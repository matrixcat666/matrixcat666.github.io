<p>Here I made a little "choose your own adventure" styled thing (well almost) where you get to see an expression of some of my thoughts. I may or may not have been influenced by watching Alice in Wonderland for the first time 2-3 weeks ago to make what is a fever dream of traveling through some of the stuff I think about. I included some stuff I like such as cats and cute fictional men, as well as a couple of references to some movies and songs I like, as well as a cursed gif spam to represent the raging hellfires of my disturbed, constantly-running-with-thoughts mind.</p>
