<p>These are photos of my 3 cats, but edited to make glitch effects. From left to right respectively, they feature: My cat Cedric, edited with TextEdit; My cat Tiny Ting, edited with Audacity; and Neville, edited with TextEdit and then Audacity. I love cats; I'm just a huge cat person. The glitching could represent how cats sometimes, in a way, "glitch" in behavior. They act silly and dumb for no reason sometimes, but it's something we ultimately love about them.</p>
