<p>My name's Ephreen Ahmed, pronounced "Ef-REEN əh-med". I'm 20 years old, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I'm currently attending San Jose State University as an undergraduate sophomore.</p>
<p>I've always had a knack for creativity and making creative works, especially with traditional art and creative writing.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite things besides creative works are cats, Minecraft, RWBY, Harry Potter, comedy, shitpost-y comedy, video games  and movies. You may find some of these incorporated into my works.</p>
