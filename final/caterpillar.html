  <h1 style="background-color:LightGreen;">You have chosen the Green Mushroom!</h1>
  <p>The box tumbles out of the machine. You take the mushroom out of the box and eat it.</p>
  <p>You shrink. It feels weird. But you made the correct choice. You crawl through the hole and then return to normal size once you make it to the other side, arriving in front of a golden set of doors. Guess there's more than one reason why we called these caterpillar mushrooms.</p>
  <p>Ok now we're gonna go on to a more direct puzzle. See these doors? They're guarded by 3 creepy creatures: a Zombie Bear, a Dog Skeleton, and an oversized Mutant Ant. They will all try to kill you if you try to go for the doors, so you're going to have to take them out or sedate them.</p>
  <p>A set of 3 different tools has been given to you: a Spiked Ball, a Chemical Dart, and a Capsule of Poison. Each can only be used on one creature. And each only works on one kind of creature. Use a tool on the wrong creature and you'll provoke it to kill you.</p>
  <p>We've left you 2 clues to figure out which tool is to be used on which creature. Good luck.</p>
