  <h1 style="background-color:AliceBlue;">You have chosen the correct Number!</h1>
  <p>The wall lifts, allowing you to go to the next room! Easy, wasn't it? Okay, okay, I'll admit, it probably was as difficult if you added the difficulty levels of the two challenges before that... just like you had to do with these numbers to figure out the next one in the sequence. See, told ya I wasn't fibbing.</p>
  <p>Alright, next challenge. This one will be less fun, you know why? Because it doesn't require you to do math stuff.</p>
  <p>The way to the next chamber requires temporarily shrinking yourself because the passageway is super small. <i>There are 3 "Caterpillar Mushrooms"</i>. They're called that because they make you as small as a caterpillar. Only, only one of them is the kind that will make you shrink down. The others are toxic. Each kind is in a box with a label on it. Pressing a button will vend a box containing the respective mushroom. It's up to you to find and eat the correct mushroom.</p>
  <p>Also. Because I'm nice, I'll also tell you some <i>Fun Animal Facts!!!</I> :DDDD I imagine it might lighten up your mood a bit.</p>
  <p>Fun Animal Fact 1: Mayflies have a lifespan of 2 days. So they just spend most of this time mating. What a bunch of losers hahaha.</p>
  <p>Fun Animal Fact 2: Female mosquitos are the only ones that bite humans because they need that blood to produce eggs. Not that I really care anyways, if I see a mosquito I'm killing it on the spot and I don't have the patience to check its sex first. Mosquitos are creepy and nasty and carry malaria. F*ck them.</p>
  <p>Fun Animal Fact 3: Wasps are nasty and contribute nothing good to society that bees and spiders don't already do.</p>
  <p>Fun Animal Fact 4: Some caterpillars are brightly colored (as opposed to more plain/lightly colored like green) because they contain toxic/bad tasting chemicals. It's a survival tactic to warn nasty-ass predators away. Predators should be bloody grateful to those caterpillars if you ask me, the caterpillars literally went out of their way to tell the predators "Hey I'm poison so don't eat me". Win win situation.</p>
  <p>Fun Animal Fact 5: Most spiders actually don't try to kill you. But they're still friggin creepy sometimes. And it's always still good to handle and remove them carefully or get an adult/someone experienced. Cause you never know.</p>
  <p>Fun Animal Fact 6: Ladybug larvae are super voracious and will eat aphids, mites, other insects' eggs, and even other ladybug eggs. Yeah who knew ladybug babies were so nasty.</p>
